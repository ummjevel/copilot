ummjevel: @workspace Describe this project

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThis project is a C#/.NET 8.0 solution for a library management system, organized into multiple layers and projects:

- **Library.ApplicationCore**: Contains core domain entities (such as `Patron`, `Book`, `Loan`), enums, and service/repository interfaces (e.g., `IPatronRepository`, `ILoanService`). It also implements business logic in services like `PatronService` and `LoanService`.

- **Library.Infrastructure**: Implements data access using JSON files as storage, with repositories such as `JsonPatronRepository` and `JsonLoanRepository`. Data is loaded and saved via the `JsonData` class.

- **Library.Console**: A console application that provides a user interface for searching patrons, viewing patron and loan details, renewing memberships, extending loans, and returning books. The main logic is in `ConsoleApp`, with configuration in `appSettings.json` and sample data in the `Json/` directory.

- **UnitTests**: Contains xUnit-based unit tests for core business logic, using NSubstitute for mocking repositories. Factories like `PatronFactory` and `LoanFactory` help generate test data.

- **CI/CD**: A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/build-test.yml) builds and tests the project on pull requests to the main branch.

**Summary:**  
The solution demonstrates a clean architecture for a library system, separating domain logic, infrastructure, and presentation, with JSON-based persistence and comprehensive unit testing.

ummjevel: @workspace #editor Describe the ConsoleApp class

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThe `ConsoleApp` class in ConsoleApp.cs is the main entry point for the console-based user interface of the library management system. It manages the application's state machine and user interactions for searching patrons, viewing patron and loan details, renewing memberships, extending loans, and returning books.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Maintains the current UI state using the `ConsoleState` enum.
- Handles user input and transitions between states such as patron search, search results, patron details, and loan details.
- Interacts with the domain layer via injected services and repositories: `IPatronRepository`, `ILoanRepository`, `IPatronService`, and `ILoanService`.
- Provides methods for:
  - Searching patrons by name and displaying results.
  - Selecting a patron to view details and their loans.
  - Renewing a patron's membership.
  - Selecting a loan to view details, extend the loan, or mark it as returned.
  - Handling user input options and displaying available actions.

The class uses a loop in the `Run` method to keep the application running, switching between states based on user actions. It prints information to the console and reads user input to drive the workflow.

ummjevel: @workspace #editor Describe the Program.cs file

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThe Program.cs file is the entry point for the console application. It configures dependency injection and application services, then starts the main application loop.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Builds an `IServiceCollection` and registers all required services and repositories, including:
  - `IPatronRepository` as `JsonPatronRepository`
  - `ILoanRepository` as `JsonLoanRepository`
  - `ILoanService` as `LoanService`
  - `IPatronService` as `PatronService`
  - `JsonData` and `ConsoleApp` as singletons
- Loads configuration from appSettings.json
- Builds the service provider and resolves the `ConsoleApp` instance
- Starts the application by calling `consoleApp.Run().Wait();`

This setup enables dependency injection throughout the application and ensures all components are properly initialized before the main loop begins.

ummjevel: @workspace /explain Explain how the data access classes work

Workspace: The data access classes (`JsonPatronRepository`, `JsonLoanRepository`, and `JsonData`) manage reading and writing library data using JSON files as storage. Here’s how they work together:

---

### 1. **JsonData**
- **Purpose:** Centralizes loading, saving, and populating in-memory data from JSON files for all entities (Patrons, Loans, Books, etc.).
- **How it works:**
  - On startup or when needed, loads data from JSON files into in-memory lists (e.g., `Patrons`, `Loans`).
  - Provides methods to save updated lists back to JSON files (`SavePatrons`, `SaveLoans`).
  - Offers "populate" methods (e.g., `GetPopulatedPatron`, `GetPopulatedLoan`) to enrich entities with related data (like attaching a patron’s loans or a loan’s book details).

---

### 2. **JsonPatronRepository**
- **Purpose:** Implements `IPatronRepository` to provide CRUD operations for patrons.
- **How it works:**
  - Uses `JsonData` to ensure data is loaded before any operation.
  - **SearchPatrons:** Finds patrons whose names contain the search input, sorts them, and populates their related data.
  - **GetPatron:** Finds a patron by ID and populates their related data.
  - **UpdatePatron:** Updates patron details in memory, saves the updated list to the JSON file, and reloads data to keep everything in sync.

---

### 3. **JsonLoanRepository**
- **Purpose:** Implements `ILoanRepository` to provide CRUD operations for loans.
- **How it works:**
  - Uses `JsonData` to ensure data is loaded before any operation.
  - **GetLoan:** Finds a loan by ID and populates its related data (like the book and patron).
  - **UpdateLoan:** Updates loan details in memory, saves the updated list to the JSON file, and reloads data.

---

### **Key Points / Gotchas**
- **Data Consistency:** After updates, data is saved and reloaded to ensure in-memory data matches the JSON files.
- **Populating Entities:** "Populate" methods attach related objects (e.g., a loan’s book or a patron’s loans), so returned objects are fully detailed.
- **Async Operations:** All file operations are asynchronous to avoid blocking the main thread.

---

**Analogy:**  
Think of `JsonData` as a librarian who fetches and updates the library’s records from storage, while the repositories (`JsonPatronRepository`, `JsonLoanRepository`) are the front desk clerks who handle specific requests using the librarian’s help.
